# Final Project: Mimikyu's Day Off

Codename: POKE-ROGUE! ‚≠êÔ∏è

[Play it yourself](https://mimikyus-day-off.vercel.app/)!

Our Lighthouse Labs final group project - a pokemon-themed roguelite-style game.

( NOTE: Roguelite games are designed in such a way that the game is impossible to beat on the first run. Each failed attempt gives the player new abilities or stat buffs for future attempts. )

Experience Mimikyu's adventures on his day off - an encounter with a clueless thief!
